**Meeting Date:** 21st Jan, 2026 - 9:56 AM

**Tim Scullion** *[00:00]*: Cool. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[00:00]*: Okay. All right, so let me share my screen and let's just, yeah. Talk through like kind of what you'd want to see for these remaining stages. 
**Tim Scullion** *[00:13]*: Yeah. So I'm assuming we want to keep these future things here so that they can be filled in later so we can just kind of make them manual. So like after I click push line items and create quote, I'm now in HubSpot. I have my quote. I'm going to send the email in HubSpot to the person and follow Up with them via email until they get back. So like after I do that, I can just come in here and so is the only thing this could be done through tracking a deal through HubSpot or it could be done through me coming in and clicking. So this is going to be the first part where I like duplicate work. Right. 
**Tim Scullion** *[01:04]*: So like after I send it in HubSpot, I'm going to drag the deal card to quote sent and then come in here and check quote sent. If it just knows that it's there and then checks it, that's fine. But again, it's a level of more complicated. Like, okay, can literally just say like quote sent or like confirm quote sent. Yes. Confirm when quote approved. Yes. Prepare engagement agreement prepared. Yes. Engagement sent for review. Yes. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[01:42]*: Okay. Yeah, so, okay, so we could do like once you get the link for the quote, like that's the end of this, of the create quote stage. And then you'll be in HubSpot, you'll send the email and then in quote sent it will just say like have you sent the quote? And you'll do yes. And then it'll also be like a reminder to say please make sure to move the HubSpot deal to quote sent as well. Like or confirm that it already is or something like that. 
**Tim Scullion** *[02:21]*: Wait, hold on. I'm confused by this quote sent thing. I thought it was. I'm sending it manually through HubSpot. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[02:31]*: No, you are. This is. I haven't touched this in weeks. Like this was like. I think it generated some of this just based off of old okay conversation, but it doesn't have any database or automations tied to this. So. Okay, so yeah, so quote sent. It will just say like have you sent the quote? And you'll hit yes. And there maybe be some type of reminder to also say make sure you move or confirm that the deal in HubSpot is in quote sent. So that's what this one could be quote approved will be like, I guess just like yes or no. And then if there's if it's yes, do you have a HubSpot stage for that? 
**Tim Scullion** *[03:21]*: Like close one prepare engagement agreement. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[03:25]*: Prepare engagement agreement. So you would say quote or quote approved. You hit yes and then it'll do a reminder to say move to prepare engagement agreement. And then if no, should we just jump to like close lost or something. 
**Tim Scullion** *[03:44]*: Or. See, this is the part. My brain doesn't like this because all of this is just duplicating HubSpot. Like we could literally just delete all of the blocks under quote set and I'm fine because all we're going to. You know what I mean? All we're doing is duplicating because it does seem dumb for me to click into one thing and click into another. But I also do want to get the end result here. So like having a checkbox thing where I like I said like quote sent yes and get like prepare engagement agreement. Yes. Engagement agreement approved. Yes. Engagement agreement sent, yes. And then like close one closed loss. But I wouldn't want it to be anything beyond that because it's just duplicating work. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[04:36]*: Got it. 
**Tim Scullion** *[04:40]*: The only other thing is like I said is if it just lit Up the like turned the one green when it notices the deal. Like quote is approved when the deal moves into prepare engagement. Like send engagement is when it moves to engagement sent. Close one is when it moves to close one. Close losses and music. Right. So I'm almost thinking about being like from here on out, just being a pizza tracker. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[05:12]*: Right. 
**Tim Scullion** *[05:12]*: So just a domino's pizza tracker of where the deal is. Because the name of the deal or like the name of the plate of the column stage tells you what's going on. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[05:22]*: Yeah. Okay. 
**Tim Scullion** *[05:25]*: Right. So what? So we do the create quote in here. It sends it to HubSpot and it's in create quote. I then send the quote and drag it and move it to quote sent. It'd be cool as hell if it knew that it was in quote sent and then just said like put a green check mark next to it, you know, to something like that. But again, I'm not trying to over complicate it. I want this project to be over. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[05:53]*: Yeah, no, I think I can think of a solution based off of what you just said. Like, like you pretty much gave the solution but just like best way to visualize that. 
**Tim Scullion** *[06:04]*: Yeah, I'm just picturing these things turning green as they like you hit that thing. So like when I send the engagement agreement, I drag it into engagement agreement sent, then send engagement turns green when it Gets drug into closed one, then that thing turns green. You know, because this is only just a checklist. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[06:29]*: Right. 
**Tim Scullion** *[06:30]*: For now. I think is the best way to do it. Now it's whether or not you can easily make it an automated checklist that it checks off of HubSpot or if I just have to go in and click again, it's not the end of the world. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[06:42]*: Okay, well that makes sense. I will. I'll pretty much. Yeah, I'll. I'll try to see if I can do it from HubSpot. If not, then I'll make it manual for now. But I probably put. 
**Tim Scullion** *[06:58]*: I would also get rid of the walkthrough. I don't know what an engagement walkthrough is. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[07:03]*: I know that was their wording, but Prepare Engagement Monster. 
**Tim Scullion** *[07:07]*: Yeah, I think maybe that might be from streams. Oh yeah. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[07:12]*: I think like, yeah, this was gonna be like if we had this stage, like guide you through, like give you. 
**Tim Scullion** *[07:21]*: All the things that are going to be entered into ignition. All right. Screw. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[07:25]*: Yeah. So yeah, internal review. Do the rest of these have a stage in HubSpot? So just get rid of this one? 
**Tim Scullion** *[07:40]*: No, not even get rid of it. Should be Prepare engagement agreement. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[07:47]*: Okay. 
**Tim Scullion** *[07:54]*: Now quote approved is equal to prepare engagement agreement. You know what I mean? Prepare engagement agreement only happens when the quote has been approved. Otherwise it stays in quote sent or goes to close lost. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[08:13]*: Got it. 
**Tim Scullion** *[08:18]*: Oh, now we gotta do the HubSpot dance. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[08:23]*: I think it's actually working this time. There we go. All right, so we have. I can map it here my head. So we already have the automation that moves to create quote send just prepare. 
**Tim Scullion** *[08:43]*: Ea. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[08:45]*: EA ready for review send close one close lost. Got it. Okay, so very much like you said, like we just want like just to represent what HubSpot stages it's in for. 
**Tim Scullion** *[09:14]*: Yeah. So like thinking about it this way, it could literally, if weren't going to build out the rest in the future, it could just be a deal status thing that just said what stage it was in. You know what I mean? But because we're going to build it separately instead of just telling you what stage we need to have it, like check off each one of those stages in the thing. Right. That's kind of what I'm saying. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[09:36]*: Got it. Okay. Represent sqo quote sent onwards in the timeline. Okay, cool. I will, I will make sure to. To do that. Yeah. And then I think the last thing I had was just like, yeah, it might be tough to reset it, but just looking at. Well, I feel like that's probably just going to come with feedback once we've set this live. I mean, we've reviewed it along the way. I was going to say, like, you want to look into, like, any of the wording or, like, how these stages look, but that might be kind of hard to go through. 
**Tim Scullion** *[10:44]*: Yeah, it's hard for me to tell until. Because I haven't used it. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[10:47]*: Yeah, yeah. So I think that'll just come naturally. All right, cool. So I plan on wrapping this Up and setting it live, and then I'll let you know. And then you can feel free. You can feel free to, like, start fresh here and all that and, like, remove these and, you know, this is all testing ones and ones that just kind of came through as I was building, so. Yeah. And then I could really start keeping a close eye on it once it's in production to make sure everything's flowing smoothly. And then as we capture some of the. Any initial issues, we should be able to iron everything out. 
**Tim Scullion** *[11:38]*: Cool. Yeah, I'm excited, man. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[11:40]*: Yeah. 
**Tim Scullion** *[11:43]*: Yeah. The last part's a little bit weird, but I think we're on the same page. It's almost just a visual representation. And then when we come back later, we'll make it actually do the stuff. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[11:53]*: Yeah, yeah, totally agree. Hopefully this helps out a lot. Yeah. And yeah, even if you want to create a separate Google Doc as you start using it, like sales pipeline, I'll. 
**Tim Scullion** *[12:08]*: Definitely make a feedback doc. Yeah, I will. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[12:10]*: Yeah. And just track that along the way, and then I'll make sure to get everything in, so. 
**Tim Scullion** *[12:16]*: Yeah, man, sounds good. All right, well, thank you so much. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[12:21]*: Of course. All right, Hope you have a good one. I will reach out when it's all set. Cool, dude. Thank you. All right, bye.
