**Nicolas Sementilli** *[00:16]*: Hello? I don't think I can hear you. I don't know if it's. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[00:30]*: Okay. Yeah, done. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[00:35]*: It's funny how that works. You can just leave. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[00:38]*: So annoying. I'm doing good. Still, like, stuffy, which is just so annoying. I'm like, I just want to be done. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[00:49]*: Yeah, that is the worst. I. I had that, like, the end of December, like, pretty bad. And then it, like, kind of came back last week, and it's like, it. It, like, takes so long. Like, I feel like I haven't been sick for, like, a week, but it's like the congestion just, like, slowly, slowly, like, dissipates. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[01:11]*: Exactly. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[01:12]*: It's like. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[01:12]*: Yeah, that's exactly how it is. It's like, I don't. I'm not, like, so sick, but I am still sick, I guess. Yeah, it's just, like, all in there. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[01:22]*: Yeah, that's. That's the worst. But hopefully it gets better and better each day. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[01:27]*: Yeah. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[01:28]*: All right. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[01:32]*: I shared with you a document, just kind of, like, quick thoughts that I put together for the, like, hypothesis builder. So if we want to take a look at that and then at whatever point when you want to, if you want to go over the other stuff first, that's fine, but just so that we can have that on the recording and everything. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[01:55]*: Cool. Yeah. I'll run through with just some quick updates, and then we'll talk through Hypothesis Lab, repurpose content, and then content refresh. Perfect. Okay. My screen. All right, so for Topic Radar, the approved ideas will now appear in Brief Builder when clicking new brief. So if we run some ideas here and then say we'll just approve one of them, it'll fall off Topic Radar. And then when you go to do a new brief, you can create a custom one or there's, like, approved topic ideas, and then you can start, like, with one of those ideas. Okay. And then when we're working with the brief builder, I think outline is still the same. But then if you go to first draft, I added approve and deny buttons for each faq. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[03:23]*: So you'll like, kind of like there's the first draft, and then you can come in here and you can accept or deny, like, certain FAQs that you want to be in, like, the final draft. And then same with the internal links, you can accept or remove them, and then you can also add them. So for internal, you can, like, search against, like, the library. So if you do, like, let's say understanding financial statements, and then it'll bring that in. And then also for external links, if there's one that you can think of. Then you can be like, nice. You know, you just put a name to it and then the link and it will add that in. And then also in here there's like a refine with AI. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[04:22]*: So this is where you would be able to give feedback for the draft FAQs or links to have it like kind of regenerate in a sense, so you can type in your feedback, send that in, and then it should. Right now it doesn't, but in the future it will adjust these based off your feedback. Nice. Anything from any of that so far that you would want adjusted or anything that comes to mind? Nope. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[04:59]*: Looks great. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[05:00]*: Cool. All right, so then you can approve the draft and you can select a author that will be recommended. And then the final review stage, it's going to show, I think, like, a bigger summary than we had before. Like, it'll show everything. So, like the final draft and then the approved FAQs and approved links. And then after you approve a final draft, just for like a better user experience, it will actually bring you into the final draft tab to show that it's in here. And then you can either copy everything or once it's published, you can hit publish and then it'll move it into the library. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[05:52]*: Okay. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[05:57]*: And I also extended the. Here. Okay. I extended this. Like, I know we, like, had only built it for blog post, but I just did kind of like early stages of what this would look like for these other content formats too. So, like, if we do like YouTube video, it should look a little bit different to kind of fit that piece, still have like the timestamps and the draft will look a little bit more appropriate for like a YouTube video. And I guess one thing on your end is like, I'm not sure like, which ones you would want, like FAQs and like links for other than just blog posts. So I don't know if we should remove that for the other content types. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[07:08]*: Yeah, I think for the blog post and case study, we can have FAQs, but for the YouTube description we wouldn't. What would be a little bit different for the YouTube description is within YouTube descriptions, they. They call them chapters, where they basically like split out the video based on what you're talking about and it'll use the, like, exact time frame of. Let's say you're talking about accounting for two minutes. You're talking about bookkeeping specific things for two minutes. And I can give you, like, examples of what that looks like normally. Like, if I do a YouTube description, I just ask ChatGPT to like split it out for me with the transcri. Okay, so that would be one thing that we would add. There is like the chapters that we would add to the description. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[08:05]*: Okay, that makes sense. We could, I could definitely adjust for that. So you just said. So FAQs and internal links will be only applied for. Or FAQs internal and external links will be for blog posts and case studies only for those two, right? 
**Alison Bulmer** *[08:26]*: Yes. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[08:28]*: Okay. And then YouTube video. We have to make sure we handle chapters. What about these two here? LinkedIn post and website page? 
**Alison Bulmer** *[08:43]*: So LinkedIn post. Yeah, it would be more about creating the post. It could still have links in it, but it would be more about. I don't think it's as important. Like it would be more about what we're talking about. So if we're creating a LinkedIn post from a blog, then we would link that blog. So it wouldn't need like multiple website page. I think that is more referring to like our standard like service pages. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[09:26]*: Yeah. Is that needed here for like. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[09:30]*: I don't think so. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[09:32]*: Yeah. Okay. Because I think it's probably not super frequent that we add like new static pages to the website, but we add. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[09:43]*: Some like here and there. Like right now I'm adding one for an ad, but yeah, wouldn't. I don't know if this would be helpful in that scenario. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[09:55]*: Okay. Okay, so we can remove website page from brief builder. Okay, let's see here. And then some UI updates. I removed the content assistant at the bottom for now, like the AI chat, like the overall one. I might add that back. But I think we'll see as we build out each of these workflows if they're just going to have a chat within each one, like how you saw with brief builder where you can refine it with the chat. So. So we'll see if like that will suffice, like having those chats like in the workflows or if we would need like a more overall one. And then my thought process there too is like, if we do want like a more like overall chat, I feel like it'll probably better to have that like housed in a different platform. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[10:56]*: Like whether it's like ChatGPT or something like something else like that. Like that will have access to some of this data. So we'll have to sort that out later. So I just removed that for now. And then I also redesigned this up here to make it a little bit more, a little bit smaller and like a little better looking. So updated that Quick. And then for Lead Discovery, I removed TriggerFi Tracker, the clay Pipeline and the Lead Queue and the Pipeline visualization. So it's just simplified to like these two workflow cards, the Influencer Finder and Hypothesis Lab. And then I also removed the Lead Discovery assistant, like Chatbot at the bottom here too for the same reasons. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[11:48]*: So for Influencer finder it's now LinkedIn only and there's like a Run Discovery button where you can just click like general and it will, you know, have a little loading screen discovering influencers and then you can go ahead and view them. And then there's also like custom where it's like what type of influence are you looking for? You can say like fractional CFOs and run that. And there'll be Loading screen and populate those. So it will. This list will start as empty and then as you click those, it will populate it with like test data. There's a Discover tab. So these are the ones that the AI will bring in or think have some good opportunity. And then you can for each one you'll have like some details, view their LinkedIn profile. If you reject them, they'll fall off the list completely. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[12:49]*: If you approve some, they'll go to this Approve tab and then in the Approve tab they'll be like ready to add to trigify. And here you could still view their profile or remove them from this approved list. Or you can say that you've added them to TriggerFi, which I think will be manual, but we'll have to see when we get to that automation, Add them like already in Trigify and you can still view their profile or remove them to bring them back to like this Ready to Add list. Or if you want to remove them completely, you just like remove them from this section and then remove them from Ready to Add. So that's how this works in simple terms of right now. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[13:49]*: I like it. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[13:50]*: Yeah. Any feedback there? 
**Alison Bulmer** *[13:54]*: No, I think just good feedback that it's simple to the point. Like I don't think it needs anything else. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[14:02]*: Cool, awesome. And like how many? I think you said like it's pretty limited, like how many you can track and trigger fire at once. Is there like I can only have. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[14:12]*: 10, 10 at a time. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[14:13]*: Okay. Yeah. Cool. So yeah, this way you can like see which ones are being tracked and then like ones that you might want like on deck or something like if you want to swap some out or so. Okay. And then Hypothesis Lab, I just kept it simple for now since I know you. We kind of had it on pause. So there's just a dropdown where there's general ideas. Similar just loading screen will populate, some prepending for review and then also custom where it's like, what type of leads are you looking for? And you can say startups or something like that and generate ideas that way. And I think right now it's really just like pending review and you can reject them, fall off the list. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[15:04]*: You can approve it to go to approved and then it'll say approved and you can move back to pending for some of them. So it's just very simple right now. Nice. Yep. Oh, yeah. And then one other. One last update I did go ahead and push the latest code live so you can go in and like pretend to go through some of your workflows on your own and like jot down any feedback you notice or things that you may need like added, adjusted or removed. Because I know sometimes like going through this on your own and like kind of pretending you're in the workflow, like you might notice, like, oh, like, I'll need this feature, I'll need this. That there might be some gaps. So you can go to this link at any point to that. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[16:05]*: I'll have Sophia go through it since she's like, not in these calls just to see if, like there's anything. She kind of thinks. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[16:14]*: Yeah. And it's just this is like a live Console. So it's like we have like some of the streams and revop stuff here, but you just go on the Marketing tab and you can check out these two here. So perfect. And so I think I will. I'm going to find a way to keep doing this because I think I like this idea of like pushing the updates live to you guys, like each day. But it might end up going to a separate link and if it does, I will share that with you. It might be like more of a preview link instead of like how I did it live for this time yesterday. So I'll make sure to update you on that. But Cool. Yeah. So now we could just go through. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[17:01]*: We can go through the document for Hypothesis Lab, see what we want to build out there. Okay. I try to find what you count here. Okay, let me reshare. Okay. Yeah, so if you just want to give like an overview of what you jotted down here, of what you're kind of thinking for what we can build out for Hypothesis Lab. Yeah. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[17:39]*: So two ways to begin, which I think we kind of already have, which is like general idea generation from the hypothesis Lab and then Specific idea prompts from us. So for the like, generalized idea, basically I have it. It would start with including, like who and where, as in, like who are we targeting and where are we finding them? And examples of where we are finding them is like, are we building a list in Clay? Are we, are we getting them from tracking an influencer in Trigafy? Or do we have like another lead list that we have like as a CSV that we can upload from that would then need to get like approved or denied. Like, do we like this idea? And then from there the bot could then go and think about how we're going to filter it down. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[18:37]*: So for example, if it says who we are targeting companies who just raised a be. And how we want to filter that down is by industry. So we want to make sure we're only looking at CPG companies. We want to know the year it was raised, how much money they raised, and like filter it that way. Like, we only want to target people who raised at least a million to $10 million, something like that. And we want to only target them if they raised it within the last year. So from that would help us with what we're enriching. So that would tell us, you know, this is the filters from what, like the information that we're given from Clay. But then here's what we need to enrich the year that the money was raised. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[19:29]*: They don't automatically give you the CEO's name of the company. If we want like a LinkedIn account, which we do, and then the CEO's email, that would all need to be enriched, which it's. We wouldn't want the bot to do the enrichment. That's what we would do in Clay. That would be manual, but it would tell us what we want to enrich. And then from there, once we approve or edit that, it would push it to the next step where it would create email copy for campaign that once we have all of the enrichment information, we can then push that to instantly, which is what we use to send out our campaigns. And within there the bot would generate. Well within this, it would generate the copy, like, hey, blah, blah, and like what we're sending to them. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[20:21]*: That way we can copy and paste it into the campaign. And then from there it would also create just a LinkedIn message, just like a short message. All of this we would obviously feed with current campaign language that we use. So it has an idea of like how we send these messages and just create. Because what we like to do is also reach out on LinkedIn. And a lot of times like it. Once they open the email, then we'll reach out on LinkedIn afterwards. So then it would create that copy. So that would be the full workflow, and then it would kind of finish and we would take over. And then for the second one, the specific idea prompt, it's basically going to be the same thing, except we're coming up with that, like who and where. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[21:10]*: Like, the first step, we're giving it with, like, as much detail as possible, but then it can still run the next workflow. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[21:17]*: Okay, that makes sense. And so Hate reach is where we reach out on LinkedIn. So it would. You would want, like, Heyreach copy is like the LinkedIn message copy. And then for the email campaigns, is that also through heyreach or is that through something else that works? 
**Alison Bulmer** *[21:36]*: That's through something else. It's called Instantly. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[21:38]*: Oh, Instantly. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[21:40]*: And both of those, we're able to push, like, directly through Clay. So, like, we create campaigns in both Instantly and Hayreach, but then all of the data in Clay we just manually push to Instantly or heyreach. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[22:00]*: So could you go like, a little bit more in detail on that? So, like, what's being pushed from clay to heyreach? Like, the actual copy and, like, messages and stuff like that? 
**Alison Bulmer** *[22:12]*: No, it would be just like the. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[22:16]*: Who to reach out to, the name. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[22:18]*: The email, and then any other variables that we add. But the actual copy lives within Instantly in heyreach. So really what we do when we're in clay is we'll say add this lead to instantly, and then when we're in that column, it'll have a dropdown and it'll say, like, which Instantly campaign? And, like, what information do you want to bring over? 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[22:43]*: Got it. So it's just like an easy way to have, like, this big list of people and to enroll them into these campaigns and instantly. And hey, retrieve from clay. Yes, got it. Okay, that makes sense. Cool. Yeah, this is great. Thank you for putting this together. This is very helpful. I think we can build out something nice for this. Yeah. Any other. Any other context or anything you want to bring in here. But I think this document and what you just said should bring us to a great point tomorrow to present kind of what this should look like. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[23:25]*: Yeah, I think that's everything for right now. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[23:28]*: Cool. All right, next up that I wanted to talk through was the repurposed content and content refresh. So I know we haven't really done too much talking about those two yet, so let's focus on repurposed content first. If. Is there any type of. I think right now we just have view content and then there's like, it shows like one piece of content says transform into blank or blank. So this is definitely very high level. I think this is needs to be improved. Do you think maybe this could be like, since we have the library in here, maybe it could be. Well, I guess part of it. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[24:27]*: I'm thinking like, yeah, you go repurposed content. Like with the library, it's almost like we know what we want to repurpose already. So we could just type in the name of the blog and that would be the way to start it. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[24:44]*: Got it. Okay. Yeah, because I was going to say I didn't know if we wanted to like, just search against the library and start there or if you wanted AI to help surface what to repurpose. So yeah. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[25:00]*: I think it's. We'll know like what we want and a lot of it will end up being like the new stuff anyways. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[25:08]*: Got it. Cool. So just like a way to kind of go in here. You can do a search against the library, select a blog post that or something else. Other content types are existing and then. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[25:20]*: Okay, maybe there's two options. There's one, there's a way to search against it, and then the second one is like, content ready to be repurchased. Like, we know that this blog was created last week and then you can kind of check off once it's done and it'll get removed. And then also there's a way just to like, input a blog that you want to repurpose. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[25:49]*: Got it, got it. So kind of like it'll watch for like, new items in the library and then it'll kind of say, like, oh, like you create a blog post about this. Like, we should also create a video and LinkedIn post. And X, Y and Z. Yeah, it. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[26:06]*: Could even be, I don't know, the best workflow for it. If it's just like something new coming into the library or if it's like after the brief builder, once I click like published to our website, then it pushes it down into it. But yeah, either way. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[26:23]*: Okay, yeah, that could definitely work. If we publish the content after brief builder, that can like bring in that notification and repurpose content and it could detect like the content type that was published and then would it make sense to have like a full checklist of like all the remaining content types and then maybe you can also like choose to remove or skip like some of them so, like, it's like, oh, you did a blog post. Like, here's a checklist of YouTube video, LinkedIn, like, all these other ones. And then you can choose to either go into repurposing it for that, or you can be like, mark off. Like, oh, like, we don't want to do a YouTube video for this. And, like, remove that. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[27:11]*: Yeah, that's a good idea. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[27:13]*: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then I think. I think that's. That was, like, the main complexity, like, starting that. So I think that makes sense. And then it's pretty much just, like, going to take the content from the existing post, and then it will help just kind of spit out what that content would look like in a new format. Yeah. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[27:37]*: And I think the only thing that might be different is there might need to be sections or, like, folders for, like, let's say Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube. YouTube is like, fine. It'll probably just be like, one video. But for Instagram and LinkedIn, for most of the blogs, like, we would want to pull as much, like, repurposed content as possible. So I mean, we don't want, like, a million, but, like, you know, we try to do, like, let's say five. So that way there's like, multiple options, not just, like, repurposing it once. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[28:16]*: Got it. So for, like, some content types, it'll be like, you might want to do, like, three or four posts for, like, the one piece of content, or do you just want, like, the options to look from. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[28:27]*: Like, we normally would want like, three, four, or five. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[28:32]*: Yeah. Okay. All right, cool. Trying to think if there's anything else for this. I think that makes sense. I think we'll probably get maybe a couple more ideas or tweaks once we see what the first, like, MVP of it looks like. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[28:51]*: And I'm just thinking the other end of it, maybe the beginning of it needs to start with, are we repurposing a blog, a video, or, like, a newsletter? Because sometimes it's. If we start with, like, Abigail writes a newsletter on hr, I'll then repurpose that into a blog, and then same for a YouTube video. If we film a YouTube video, then I'll repurpose that into a blog. Like, kind of take the transcript and turn it into a blog. So maybe that's how it has to start with. Like, what are. What's the starting content? And then what are we repurposing it into? 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[29:36]*: Yeah, so it should. If we have everything ultimately, like, going into the library, hopefully automatically, then I think it will. So like starting a repurposed content workflow. Ones that you've like published in the Console will pop up as like hey, like you just published this blog, like let's repurpose that one. But then the other starting point is that search against the database. So if you like come in here and you're like oh Abigail just did a newsletter, then you'd be able to look up her newsletter and then like select that and then they will already have like the content type tied to it so it knows which content is going from and then you'll just choose two like the two content type. So I think that makes sense. Yeah, cool. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[30:38]*: Yeah, I will, I think we could stop here for today and then review what's built for Hypothesis Lab and repurpose content, review that, see if there's any tweaks there and then we'll also talk through content refresh to get that built out more. But yeah, I think like timeline wise I would love to have like pretty much just like the visuals and like walkthrough experience done for everything for these two by like the end of this week and then starting next week like we can really. It'll probably be like less, there'll probably be shorter meetings for some of them because it'll be more. So just like hey, I'm working on building out the database and like the automations related to these and then I'll probably have like a few questions like to make sure we're on the right path. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[31:35]*: But yeah, I think that's the goal. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[31:39]*: Perfect, sounds good to me. One question is, are you, when you have your streams meeting do you show Dan this like update him on it? 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[31:51]*: No, there's not usually like a weekly like demo or anything of it but sometimes like Katie will throw on like an issue and be like hey, like just update me on where you guys are at and just talk through it. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[32:03]*: So yeah, cool, sounds good. Then maybe I'll kind of just give him a little tease of it in our meeting so he can get excited about it. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[32:12]*: Yeah, yeah and it's. And it's live now too on like the regular Console website so they can start to see it. And you know, none of the automations or anything is tied to it yet, but just visually so yeah, well, sounds good. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[32:26]*: Well thank you. Let me know if you need anything before tomorrow otherwise I'll see you tomorrow. You're the only person I see every single day now. It's kind of fun. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[32:35]*: Yeah, it's the same thing for me too. So I know it's all right When I see everyone else's schedules, like, I'm like. I'm like. I like. Oh, my God. I know. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[32:45]*: I'm like, I have one meeting. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[32:47]*: Yeah. Like, that's what I like. It's just like, me in the morning and then do my work, and so it's good. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[32:52]*: Yeah, me too. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[32:53]*: All right. All right. Have a go. 
**Alison Bulmer** *[32:56]*: Enjoy your day. 
**Nicolas Sementilli** *[32:57]*: Bye.
